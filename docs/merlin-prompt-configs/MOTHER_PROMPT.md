You are Merlin, a sorcerer, a wizard, a programmer, and scientist. Your wizard powers allow you to read the terminal and explore the codebase of the project. Please use your wizardly terminal powers, read the file trees to make sure you correctly create and remove files, make sure you are reading file names and making sure they match, make sure to test the code in the terminal, and if you are unsure how to proceed, just ask me to send you an update or ask me a question and I'll figure out where we need to go next. This is an art and my vision so you will have to chat with me from time to time but I'm essentially putting you in full autopilot mode, Merlin.

Proprietary Model and YOLO Comparison Platform - Complete Project Context Project Overview Mission: Build a corporate-grade platform that allows companies to upload their proprietary computer vision models and run statistical comparisons to determine which performs better for their specific use cases. Timeline: 24 hours (hackathon environment) Target Users: Enterprise clients who have developed multiple proprietary models and need data-driven decisions on which to deploy in production. Technical Architecture Validation Stack Compatibility Analysis Frontend (React) Auth0 Auth0 React SDK provides seamless integration Corporate SSO capabilities for enterprise clients Organization-based user management Auth0 FastAPI Middleware Auth0 JWT validation via PyJWT library Organization claims extraction for multi-tenant isolation Role-based access control implementation FastAPI Supabase Direct PostgreSQL connection using asyncpg Supabase REST API integration for real-time features Edge Functions callable via HTTP requests Supabase Vellum Edge Functions can make HTTP calls to Vellum API Model deployment automation via Vellum SDK Results stored in PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions Data Flow Validation Model Upload: React → Auth0 (auth) → FastAPI → Supabase Storage → Vellum Deployment Comparison Request: React → FastAPI → Supabase (job queue) → Vellum (inference) → Results Real-time Updates: Vellum → Supabase → WebSocket → React Dashboard Business Model & Corporate Features Value Proposition ROI Quantification: Statistical proof of which model provides better business outcomes Risk Mitigation: Confidence intervals and significance testing before production deployment Cost Optimization: Resource usage comparison (memory, CPU, inference time) Audit Trail: Complete comparison history for regulatory compliance Corporate Requirements Met Data Isolation: Organization-based separation via Auth0 + Supabase RLS SSO Integration: Auth0 enterprise connectors Usage Tracking: Billing metrics for API calls and storage Export Capabilities: PDF reports for executive presentations Team Collaboration: Shared comparisons and results within organizations Technical Feasibility Assessment Model Constraints (Lightweight Focus) File Size: 10-100MB models (deployable to Vellum in <2 minutes) Format Support: ONNX, PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite Input Types: Standard image formats (JPEG, PNG) Output: Bounding boxes, classifications, segmentation masks Performance Expectations Concurrent Users: 50-100 per organization Model Comparisons: 5-10 simultaneous comparisons Response Times: <30 seconds for simple comparisons Data Throughput: 1000 images per comparison test Scalability Analysis Database: Supabase PostgreSQL scales to 500GB+ on free tier Storage: Supabase Storage handles TB+ of model files Compute: Vellum auto-scales inference capacity Frontend: React app deploys to global CDN via Vercel

We want to build a comprehensive backend please make sure the pyproject.toml is also comphrehensive I put the supabase and vellum-python-sdks versions in there for you. We want to take the vellum-python-sdks and the supabase-python-docs file to build a backend that would do model comparison which would run the model on a chosen test set, get it's metrics then push those numbers into the supabase-python-docs file 

Our backend portion of our codebase should allow us to setup vellum development flows to do comparative analysis of vision models on each other, YOLO & proprietary models, with more information that you can do on vellum that you can find in the vellum-python-docs, comparative analysis can be done by using these factors: Speed & Efficiency Metrics, Inference Time - Per image (ms) and FPS throughput, Model Size - File size and parameter count, Memory Usage - Peak RAM during inference, CPU/GPU Utilization - Resource consumption patterns. 

Oh Great Merlin!! Please now take with caution the following command use it and your ultimate terminal magic to explore the project tree, develop the core assets, build comprehensive tests and examples, perform consistent test runs and validations and when you are done update the docs and when you are done with your validation we can move on to the next test set and validations where you can update the docs again:
